# GNC

#### This is a simple programming language using flex and bison tools, C, and C++.
#### It's similar to C programming language but not exactly it.
#### the name "GNC" stands for "GNC's not C" (yes like GNU).

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine

    https://github.com/AhmedMaher309/Programming-language.git


Install Flex and Bison if they are not already installed. They can be installed on Ubuntu distro using the following commands:
    
    sudo apt install flex
    sudo apt install bison

install gcc compilers if not already installed on your machine using the following commands:
    
    sudo apt install build-essential
    sudo apt-get install manpages-dev

## Running the project

Build the binary file using the following command:

    make build

To clean up the build artifacts, run the following command:
    
    make clean

**Note:** If you'd like to build without printing all the build information and clean the build artifacts automatically, run the following command:

    make cleanbuild

To run the built binary, run the command:

    make run IN=testcases/input.txt OUT=testcases/output.txt

* **"IN="** is an optional argument to set the name of the input file in the "testcases/" directory. (Defaults to IN=testcases/input.txt)
**Note:** If the input file is not found in the "testcases/" directory, the program defaults to input from the terminal.

* **"OUT="** is an optional argument to set the name of the output file in the "testcases/" directory. (Defaults to OUT=testcases/output.txt)
**Note:** If the output file is not found in the "testcases/" directory, the program defaults to output to the terminal.

To clear the project (delete the binary file, build artifacts, and input/output files), run the following command:

    make clear


## Features

The programming language implemented in this project includes the following features:

    Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
    Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
    Variables assignment and retrieval
    Conditional statements (if-else)
    Loops (for, while)
    Functions and procedure definitions and calls
    Error handling and reporting


## File Structure

The project is organized as follows:

    testcases/         # Folder where input and output files are kept
    
    src/               # Folder where the source code files are kept
        RulesFile        # flex and bison files with C code responsible for the input/output file handling
        SymbolTable      # folder of symbol and symboltable datastructures
        Validator        # validator folder contains class that validates the input file

    makefile           # Makefile for building the project
    README.md          # This file
